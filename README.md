# JEAP - Jodah Encryption Algorithm in Python

A python implementation of a code my friends and I developed back in high school. Shhh, it's top secret!

There are 4 intended releases:
- [x] Basic implementation
- [x] Add custom callback function
- [ ] Add wrapping on self
- [ ] Add support for using binary files instead of text strings
